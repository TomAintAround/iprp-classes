# IPRP Classes

Here you can find every exercise that I did in my university course Introdução à Programação e Resolução de Problemas (Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving). My university is in Portugal, so expect the code and comments to be in portuguese.

This is all done in Python and each python file correspond to 1 exercise.
